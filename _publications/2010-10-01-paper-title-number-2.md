excerpt: 'Pneumonia is one of the diseases that causes the most fatalities worldwide, especially in children. Recently, pneumonia-caused deaths have increased dramatically due to the novel Coronavirus global pandemic. Chest X-ray (CXR) images are one of the most readily available and common imaging modality for the detection and identification of pneumonia. However, the detection of pneumonia from chest radiography is a difficult task even for experienced radiologists. Artificial Intelligence (AI) based systems have great potential in assisting in quick and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia from chest X-rays. The aim of this study is to develop a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to find the best convolutional architecture capable of detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays. We propose a Learning by Teaching framework inspired by the teaching-driven learning methodology from humans, and conduct experiments on a pneumonia chest X-ray dataset with over 5000 images. Our proposed method yields an area under ROC curve (AUC) of 97.6% for pneumonia detection, which improves upon previous NAS methods by 5.1% (absolute).
