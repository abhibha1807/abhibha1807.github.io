excerpt: 'To advance argumentative stance prediction as a multimodal problem, the First Shared Task in Multimodal Argument Mining hosted stance prediction in crucial social topics of gun control and abortion. Our exploratory study attempts to evaluate the necessity of images for stance prediction in tweets and compare outof-the-box text-based large-language model(LLM) in few-shot settings against fine-tuned unimodal and multimodal models. Our work suggests an ensemble of fine-tuned text-based language models (0.817 F1-score) outperforms both the multimodal (0.677 F1-score) and textbased few-shot prediction using a recent stateof-the-art LLM (0.550 F1-score). In addition to the differences in performance, our findings suggest that the multimodal models tend to perform better when image content is summarized as natural language over their native pixel structure and, using in-context examples improves few-shot performance of LLMs.[Code](https://github.com/arushi-08/Argumentative-Stance-Prediction-with-Transformers)'
