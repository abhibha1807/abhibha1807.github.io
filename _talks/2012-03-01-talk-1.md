 The final project for my machine learning course was sponsored by PPG Industries which is a fortune 500 Company. Surface coatings play a role in the manufacturing of products from common household goods, eyeglasses, buildings, cars, planes, and more! Coatings prevent corrosion and prolong the useful life of industrial materials, components, and machinery. Without a properly designed surface coating, the materials we interact with would not last as long as we want them to! Properly designing coating materials requires experts in chemistry and chemical engineering, materials science, manufacturing, experimental design, and more. Experiments are performed to find the optimal material chemistry and manufacturing process conditions that minimize the amount of corroded surface after a test. 
 Machine learning models are trained using historical data to predict material performance. The trained machine learning models are then used to find the optimal constituents and process settings to minimize corrosion. This project aims to do this by performing a comparative study between various Bayesian machine learning techniques to predict the percentage of corrosion on the surface.
