The goal of the recommendation system is to spread the fun of anime to more people. We want to encourage the competition of the animation industry, by using a ranking system throughout different anime. The motivation behind the dive into this particular topic is based on our group's personal interests in the different anime genres. this system can reach audiences that are quite familiar with a variety of different anime series or those looking into what different series would align with their interests. Members may be able to obtain a recommendat We have information related to the genre, ratings, synopsis, episodes, production studio, etc at our disposal. We aim to design a recommendation system that recommends the next anime show that a user should watch. We perform data exploration to find the important features (In our case, Score and Rank). We used the ‘hybrid’ recommender model approach that weighs different methods based on popularity, randomness and recommendation. We also try to incorporate the above mentioned features into our recommender model. The results for our method are provided in the report.
