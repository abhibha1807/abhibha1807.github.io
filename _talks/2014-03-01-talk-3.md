This is a reflection on the creation of a recommendation system using R. The recommendation system was for the purpose of being able to suggest an anime to different users. The dataset was first explored through a various plots (Eg: cor plot) and the most important features were taken into consideration for the recommendation system. The different variables were evaluated as well to determine the influence between the variables. Each variable was run through an extraction and frequency function and then analyzed. After the data exploration the dataset was run through the recommendation system. We used the ‘hybrid’ approach that weighs different methods based on popularity, randomness and recommendation. The results for our method are provided in the subsequent sections. [Code](https://github.com/abhibha1807/Anime_Recommendation_System)
